# Fruit and Vegetables Leaf Disease Detection Through Deep Learning
This initiative focuses on a system for detecting leaf diseases using deep learning, incorporating transfer learning to classify 33 distinct types of leaf diseases. Trained on a substantial image dataset, the model aims to assist agricultural experts and enthusiasts in swiftly and accurately diagnosing plant ailments.


## Usage

To use the model for leaf disease detection, follow these steps:

1. Confirm the presence of a Python environment with the essential libraries installed. Utilize the provided requirements.txt file to establish the necessary dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run main.py

```
streamlit run main.py 
```

## Model Details
The leaf disease detection model is constructed through deep learning methods, employing transfer learning to capitalize on a base model's pre-existing knowledge. Trained on a dataset encompassing images of 33 distinct leaf diseases, further details regarding the architecture, dataset, and training procedures can be found within the accompanying code and documentation.
